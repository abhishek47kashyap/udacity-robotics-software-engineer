^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

2.4.2 (2016-12-22)
------------------

2.4.1 (2016-12-22)
------------------
* Modify R200 launch file.
  Modified the R200 3D sensor launch file
  to conform more closely to the other
  open_ni2-style sensor launch files. This
  allows the data processing arguments passed
  in to correctly pass through and control
  image processing.
  This allows the turtlebot_follower package,
  for example, to set "depth_processing" to
  true to enable the /camera/depth/depth_rect/
  topic with the R200 as it can with other
  cameras.
* Refactor cmd_vel_mux.
  Moved mobile_base_nodelet_manager and cmd_vel_mux to a
  common, higher-level launch file.
  Currently each base-specific mobile_base.launch.xml
  loaded the same cmd_vel_mux node with the same configuration.
  To reduce this redundancy, launching this nodelet has been
  moved to the common, higher-level mobile_base.launch.xml.
  The mobile_base_nodelet_manager has been moved up to facilitate
  this change.
* Remove unnecessary mobile_base.launch.xml layer
  mobile_base.launch.xml currently is just a pass-through to
  include the TURTLEBOT_BASE-specific launch file.  Simply
  removed this unnecessary layer.
* Contributors: Kevin C. Wells
